#2.5 Fixing Turnstile Data

import csv
def fix_turnstile_data(filenames):
    '''
    Filenames is a list of MTA Subway turnstile text files. A link to an example
    MTA Subway turnstile text file can be seen at the URL below:
    http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_110507.txt
    
    As you can see, there are numerous data points included in each row of the
    a MTA Subway turnstile text file. 

    You want to write a function that will update each row in the text
    file so there is only one entry per row. A few examples below:
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,003178521,001100739
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,04:00:00,REGULAR,003178541,001100746
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,08:00:00,REGULAR,003178559,001100775
    
    Write the updates to a different text file in the format of "updated_" + filename.
    For example:
        1) if you read in a text file called "turnstile_110521.txt"
        2) you should write the updated data to "updated_turnstile_110521.txt"

    The order of the fields should be preserved. Remember to read through the 
    Instructor Notes below for more details on the task. 
    
    In addition, here is a CSV reader/writer introductory tutorial:

    You can see a sample of the turnstile text file that's passed into this function
    and the the corresponding updated file in the links below:

#2.6     Combining Turnstile Data
def create_master_turnstile_file(filenames, output_file):
    '''
    Write a function that takes the files in the list filenames, which all have the 
    columns 'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn', and consolidates
    them into one file located at output_file.  There should be ONE row with the column
    headers, located at the top of the file. The input files do not have column header
    rows of their own.
    
    For example, if file_1 has:
    'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn'
    line 1 ...
    line 2 ...
    
    and another file, file_2 has:
    'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn'
    line 3 ...
    line 4 ...
    line 5 ...
    
    We need to combine file_1 and file_2 into a master_file like below:
     'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn'
    line 1 ...
    line 2 ...
    line 3 ...
    line 4 ...
    line 5 ...
    '''
    with open(output_file, 'w') as master_file:
       master_file.write('C/A,UNIT,SCP,DATEn,TIMEn,DESCn,ENTRIESn,EXITSn\n')
       for filename in filenames:
        # your code here             
        # read and open filename
           with open(filename,'r') as input_file:
                #print input_file
            #write into master_file
                for i in input_file:
                #    write_out_line=[i[0],i[1],i[2],i[3],i[4],i[5],i[6],i[7]]
                    master_file.write(i)
                input_file.close()
    master_file.close()
