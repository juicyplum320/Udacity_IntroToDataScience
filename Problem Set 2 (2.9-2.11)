#2.9 - Get Hourly Exits


import pandas

def get_hourly_exits(df):
    '''
    The data in the MTA Subway Turnstile data reports on the cumulative
    number of entries and exits per row.  Assume that you have a dataframe
    called df that contains only the rows for a particular turnstile machine
    (i.e., unique SCP, C/A, and UNIT).  This function should change
    these cumulative exit numbers to a count of exits since the last reading
    (i.e., exits since the last row in the dataframe).
    
    More specifically, you want to do two things:
       1) Create a new column called EXITSn_hourly
       2) Assign to the column the difference between EXITSn of the current row 
          and the previous row. If there is any NaN, fill/replace it with 0.
    
    You may find the pandas functions shift() and fillna() to be helpful in this exercise.
    
    Example dataframe below:

          Unnamed: 0   C/A  UNIT       SCP     DATEn     TIMEn    DESCn  ENTRIESn    EXITSn  ENTRIESn_hourly  EXITSn_hourly

#2.10 - Time to Hour   
import pandas

def time_to_hour(time):
    '''
    Given an input variable time that represents time in the format of:
    "00:00:00" (hour:minutes:seconds)
    
    Write a function to extract the hour part from the input variable time
    and return it as an integer. For example:
        1) if hour is 00, your code should return 0
        2) if hour is 01, your code should return 1
        3) if hour is 21, your code should return 21
        
    Please return hour as an integer.

#2.11 - Reformat Subway Dates
from datetime import datetime

def reformat_subway_dates(date):
    '''
    The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.
    
    In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.
    
    Hint: 
    There is a useful function in the datetime library called strptime. 
    More info can be seen here:
    http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime
    '''

    date_formatted = datetime.strptime(date,'%m-%d-%y')
    
    # your code here
    return date_formatted.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
