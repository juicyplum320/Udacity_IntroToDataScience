#3.6 - Plotting Residuals

import numpy as np
import scipy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_residuals(turnstile_weather, predictions):
    '''
    Using the same methods that we used to plot a histogram of entries
    per hour for our data, why don't you make a histogram of the residuals
    (that is, the difference between the original hourly entry data and the predicted values).
    Try different binwidths for your histogram.

    Based on this residual histogram, do you have any insight into how our model
    performed?  Reading a bit on this webpage might be useful:

    plt.figure()
    (turnstile_weather['ENTRIESn_hourly'] - predictions).hist(bins=100)
    return plt
    
#3.7 - Compute R^2
import numpy as np
import scipy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

def compute_r_squared(data, predictions):
    '''
    In exercise 5, we calculated the R^2 value for you. But why don't you try and
    and calculate the R^2 value yourself.
    
    Given a list of original data points, and also a list of predicted data points,
    write a function that will compute and return the coefficient of determination (R^2)
    for this data.  numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() might both be useful here, but
    not necessary.

    Documentation about numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() below:
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html
    '''
    
    a= np.square( data-predictions).sum()
    b= np.square( data-np.mean(data)).sum()
    r_squared=1-a/b

    
    return r_squared
